# The Advantage Of Doubling
This code provides the model and trainer used to produce the results in [The Advantage of Doubling: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to Studying the Double Team in the NBA](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2010.pdf). The model is implemented using [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/).

While the SportsVU data we used is not publicly available, we do include a dummy dataset generator that indicates the expected input to the network. You can run the code using `python main.py`.
